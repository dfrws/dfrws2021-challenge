# DFRWS 2021 Challenge Details

Conducting forensic examinations of multiple devices seized in different circumstances and performing correlation and reconstruction to provide a more complete understanding of linked criminal activities. 

## CHALLENGE DATA
Part 1: Skimming device
Part 2: Raspberry PI
Part 3: Samsung smartphone
Part 4: QNAP NAS
Part 5: Multisource analysis and correlation

The datasets for these challenges are available for download from [Digital Corpora](https://corp.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/dfrws/challenge-2021/).

DFRWS Forensic Challenges are open to all participants and encourage participation at multiple skill levels. This competition is for open source tools (new or existing), and prizes will be awarded for the most innovative submissions.

Use of existing datasets is permitted, including those of previous DFRWS Forensic Challenges, but you may need to create your own to demonstrate the validity and significance of your approach.

## SCENARIO
As more investigations involve increasing amounts of data from a multitude of sources (e.g., computer, smartphone, IoT device, backups, networks) there is a growing need for unified approaches to analysing and correlating all available information. Multisource analysis and correlation is necessary to perform top-down analysis, to detect linkages, to discern activity patterns, to discover concealed data, and to prioritize further forensic processing.

This year we seek to put a dent in this ongoing unresolved problem.

While this is a large and complex problem, and we obviously do not expect a full solution to this issue, we are encouraging a broad range of submissions that offer partial solutions in this area from researchers across the world.

Submission can include:

innovative software prototypes
advanced multisource timelining
advanced multisource visualisations
correlated activities/identities/content across multiple sources using distinctive artifacts or more general similarities
generated multisource datasets to assist future researchers
automated normalization and correlation using interoperability standards
Any other relevant work is welcomed, and you are encouraged to think expansively and creatively.
