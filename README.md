## DFRWS 2021 Challenge Overview
The 2021 DFRWS Forensic Challenge seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in multisource analysis and correlation by focusing the communityâ€™s attention on this growing need. The format of this challenge is multipart; Parts 1 through 4 address specific devices in the scenario.  Part 5 is much more open than previous years to encourage exploration around multisource analysis and correlation and to fast track research in this broad problem space.
